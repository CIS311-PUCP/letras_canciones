Someone tell me how did I get here?
I keep on running for something, I keep on running
I got these thoughts inside my head
That I been too afraid to talk about
'Cause if we talked 'em out there'd be nothing left to talk about
So I block 'em out
All these voices at the coffee shop
But people are like dogs, yeah they bark a lot
If you're like me, then you probably tryna find some sanity
Away from all the issuesin humanity
I know I'm not the only one who feels the pain of growing up
Then looking back, just to figure out how much we all really had
Someone tell me how did I get here?
I keep on running from something, I keep on running
When I can't even look myself in the mirror
I keep on running from something, I keep on running
I keep on running from something, I keep on running
I keep on running from something, I keep on running
Early in the morning, I wake up and burn the coffee
As I'm staring out the window, watching people, watching something
I find it kinda crazy how we like to play the victim
When clearly we're the culprit of dysfunction in the system
It's like there's something missing, I'm sitting in my kitchen
Staring back at my reflection as society's dirty dishes
Someone tell me how did I get here?
I keep on running from something, I keep on running
When I can't even look myself in the mirror
I keep on running from something, I keep on running
Someone tell me how did I get here?
I keep on running from something, I keep on running
When I can't even look myself in the mirror
I keep on running from something, I keep on running
I keep on running from something, I keep on running
I keep on running from something, I keep on running
Tell me how did I get here?
Tell me how did I get here?
I keep on running from something, I keep on running
I keep on running from something, I keep on running
Someone tell me how did I get here?
I keep on running from something, I keep on running
When I can't even look myself in the mirror
I keep on running from something, I keep on running
