as long as you care

Ruel 

[Verse 1]
I'm sun-dried
My lips are high on overdrive
I'm so tired
I'm sorry if I'm low on confidence, I left at midnight
I'm sorry, but my brain is fried
I haven't seen your face in miles and miles
Always on a different continent, but don't forget me now
Or ever, 'cause I know, I know

[Chorus]
As long as you care
You have no idea
It's all bright lights and red eyes
Bright lights and red eyes
I'm never there
But as long as you're here
I'm all bright lights and red eyes
Bright lights and red eyes

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, got me working like a broke machine
Bad advice, it's why I keep on comin' home again
My fingers still bleed
Maybe this is what I need
'Cause I've been movin' on for miles and miles
Runnin' off instead of facing you, but if I do
You won't be home
When I get there and I'm runnin' outta air

[Chorus]
But as long as you care
You have no idea
It's all bright lights and red eyes
Bright lights and red eyes
I'm never there
But as long as you're here
I'm all bright lights and red eyes
Bright lights and red eyes

[Bridge]
Never wanna sleep till noon
Never wanna see you with those red eyes
Those red eyes
Never wake up in my room
Never wanna see you with those red eyes

[Chorus]
But don't cry, I know that you care (Yeah, yeah)
You have no idea (Yeah, yeah)
It's all bright lights and red eyes
Bright lights and red eyes
I'm never there
But as long as you're here (Yeah, yeah)
I'm all bright lights and red eyes (Yeah, yeah)
Bright lights and red eyes
 

[Outro]
As long as you care
Mmm-mm (Red eyes)
Mmm-mm (Red eyes)
(Red eyes)
