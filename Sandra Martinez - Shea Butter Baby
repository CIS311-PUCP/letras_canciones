Ooh
Hold it, need it, need it, yeah
Shea Butter Baby, fucking up your pillow
Touch me, take me, kiss me
Love me, depress me
Pull up, black truck, ganja
Wrist so blinding, heart so timeless
Wishing, you could meet me, see me, free me
You lost in the shape of my hips
Out there is a moon
If you really down, we can find it
Lost in an alley, make love by a trash can, ayy (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Out there is a moon (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
And if you really down we can find it
Lost in an alley, make love by a trash can
Shea Butter Baby, fucking up your pillow
Shea Butter Baby, fucking up your sheets
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
You've crossed my mind, a thousand times
The cost was fine, I draw the line
I'm back, relapse, I'm fiending
Yes, what's that? The fact, I'm dreaming
Coconut oil, the scent of your body still lingers on sheets
I got a shot at you, you wouldn't reach
Cock back, cock back, trigger release
Pop that top, take a sip of your holiest water
I know I'm a part of your flow now
See when you cut her, don't matter you love her
And now you got part of her soul, now
I ain't know then, but I know now
Apologies due, the one and the few
The ones I been through, but never loved you
I pray you found peace and you home now
I'm doin' better, I got me a chocolate bar
Climbin' on top of the bar
Think of the shape of the liquor
The places you only gonna lick when you rock with her forever
You lost in the shape of my hips
Out there is a moon
And if you really down, we can find it
Lost in an alley, make love by a trash can, ayy (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Out there is a moon (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
And if you really down we can find it
Lost in an alley, make love
Shea Butter Baby, fucking up your pillow
(I can get close to you baby, pull me closer)
Shea Butter Baby, fucking up your sheets
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(I can get close to you baby, pull me closer)
