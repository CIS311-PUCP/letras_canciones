YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL - Lana del Rey 

I've seen the world
Done it all, had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel-Air now
Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, the city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer, young and beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful?
I know you will, I know you will
I know that you will
I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
Channeling angels in, the new age now
Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful?
I know you will, I know you will
I know that you will
I know you will, I know you will
I know that you will
