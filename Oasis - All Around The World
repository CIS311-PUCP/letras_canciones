[Verse 1]
It's a bit early in the midnight hour for me
To go through all the things that I want to be
I don't believe in everything I see
Y'know I'm blind so why d'you disagree?

[Bridge 1]
Take me away
Because I just don't want to stay
And the lies you make me say
Are getting deeper every day
These are crazy days but they make me shine
Time keeps rolling by

[Chorus 1]
All around the world
You've got to spread the word
Tell them what you heard
We're gonna make a better day
All around the world
You've got to spread the word
Tell them what you heard
You know it's gonna be okay

[Verse 2]
What you going to do when the walls come falling down?
You never move
You never make a sound
And where you gonna swim with the riches that you found?
If you're lost at sea
Well, I hope that you've drowned

[Bridge 1]
Take me away
Because I just don't want to stay
And the lies you make me say
Are getting deeper every day
These are crazy days
But they make me shine
Time keeps rolling by

[Chorus 1]
All around the world
You've got to spread the word
Tell them what you heard
We're gonna make a better day
All around the world
You've got to spread the word
Tell them what you heard
You know it's gonna be o.k

All around the world
You've got to spread the word
Tell them what you heard
We're gonna make a better day
'Cause all around the world
You've got to spread the word
Tell them what you heard
You know it's gonna be o.k
'Cause all around the world
You've got to spread the word
Tell them what you heard
We're gonna make a better day
And all around the world
You've got to spread the word
Tell them what you heard
You know it's gonna be okay

[Bridge 2]
It's gonna be o.k.!
It's gonna be o.k.!
It's gonna be o.k.!

[Chorus 1]
All around the world

Tell them what you heard
We're gonna make a better day
All around the world
You've got to spread the word
Tell them what you heard
You know it's gonna be o.k
All around the world
You've got to spread the word
Tell them what you heard
We're gonna make a better day
All around the world
You've got to spread the word
Tell them what you heard
We know Its gonna be ok
