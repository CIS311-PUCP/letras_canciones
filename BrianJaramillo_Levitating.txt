Levitating
Dua Lipa
Dance
Woo-hoo
If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride (for a ride)
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life (for life)
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like (I like)
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way is liberating
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight (you're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me (come and dance with me)
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see it written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
No, we're never gonna be apart
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way is liberating
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
(Baby, won't you come and dance with me)
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight (you're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me (come on, dance with me)
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride (let me take you for a ride)
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride (I can't stop it, baby)
Let's go
Boy, I'm advanced, got my real tight pants
When I back it up, I put you in a trance (woo)
If you wanna dance, then show me all your bands
'Cause tonight, I might give you a chance (let's get it, skrrt)
Pull up in the coupe
Ooh, that dude, he look hella cute
Yeah, he lookin' at me like, "Ooh"
Suck my breasts like Betty Boop (woo)
Oh, my, my, my (my, my)
Get to stuttering like, "I-I-I" (I-I)
I'm a freak, I like to play shy
But I will get it poppin', anything, I'll try it
Say I'm on his top five list
On a Major Key like Khaled
Don't speak, open up your eyelids
I can be your girl if you keep it private
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way is liberating
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
(Come and dance with me)
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
(Come on, let me take you for a ride)
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
(Come on, let me take you for a ride)
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight (you are my starlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me (come on, dance with me)
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight (you're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
Woo-hoo
I'm levitating (woo)
Come on, come on, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
(Come on, let me take you for a ride)
I'm levitating (woo)
Come on, come on, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating (woo-hoo)
(I can't stop it baby, ah)
