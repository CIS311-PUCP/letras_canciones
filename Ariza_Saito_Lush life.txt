I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doing it all night, all summer
Doing it the way I want to
Yeah I'mma dance my heart out till the dawn
But I won't be done when morning comes
Doing it all night, all summer
Going to spend it like no other

It was a crush
But I couldn't, couldn't get enough
It was a rush
But I gave it up
It was a crush
Now I might have went and said too much
But that's all it was
So I gave it up

I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doing it all night, all summer
Doing it the way I want to
Yeah I'mma dance my heart out till the dawn
But I won't be done when morning comes
Doing it all night, all summer
Going to spend it like no other

It was a crush
I kept saying I'mma stay in touch
But that thing went bust
So I gave it up
No tricks, no bluff
I'm just better off without them cuffs
Yeah the sun won't set on us

Went low, went high
Still waters run dry
Got to get back in the groove
I ain't ever worry
Went low, went high
What matters is now
Getting right back in the mood

I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doing it all night, all summer
Doing it the way I want to
Yeah I'mma dance my heart out till the dawn
But I won't be done when morning comes
Doing it all night, all summer
Going to spend it like no other

Now I've found another crush
The lush life's given me a rush
Had one chance to make me blush
Second time is one too late
(bis)
