Oh baby, baby
Oh baby, baby

Oh baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here?

Oh baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah

Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now
Oh, because

My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess, I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

Oh baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Boy, you got me blinded

Oh, pretty baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
That's not the way I planned it

Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now
Oh, because

My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess, I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

Oh baby, baby, oh
Oh baby, baby, yeah, yeah
