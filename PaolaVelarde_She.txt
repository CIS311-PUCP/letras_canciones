Nine in the morning
The man drops his kids off at school
And he's thinking of you
Like all of us do
Sends his assistant for coffee in the afternoon
Around 1:32
Like he knows what to do

She (she)
She lives in daydreams with me (she)
She's the first one that I see
And I don't know why
I don't know who she is (she, she)

He takes a boat out
Imagines just sailing away (away, away)
And not telling his mates (not telling his mates)
He wouldn't know what to say (wouldn't know what to say, to say)

She (she)
She lives in daydreams with me (she)
She's the first one that I see
And I don't know why
I don't know who she is (she)

She (she)
She's the first one that I see (she)
She lives in daydreams with me
And I don't know why
I don't know where she is (she, she)
